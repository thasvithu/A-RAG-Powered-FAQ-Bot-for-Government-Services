This unique code is referred to as a “Uni-Code”.  In total, there are 257 \\nUni-Codes. The list of Uni -Codes is given in page no . 141-147 of the University Admissions \\nHandbook valid for the academic year 2023/2024. \\nCandidates could apply for any number of Uni -Codes (i.e. any number of courses of study of \\nuniversities) to which they are eligible to apply. However, the candidates are not eligible to apply for \\nall 257 Uni-Codes. A choice for a candidate will depend on the subjects offered at the G.C.E. \\n(Advanced Level) Examination. However, each candidate can mark up to a maximum of 125 choices \\nin the application. \\nThey should arrange their “Uni-Codes” from the highest preferred Uni-Code to the lowest preferred \\nUni-Code. Sequence should indicate the decreasing interest to a Uni -Code, in the mind of the \\ncandidate. Candidates are not allowed to enter the same Uni -Code more than one occasion in the \\norder of preference. \\nIn the selection, the course of study and the university both will be considered together.  \\n \\nCandidates are strongly advised to mark the maximum number of Uni-Codes which they are eligible \\nto apply when filling the application . Candidates are considered only for the courses of study of the \\nuniversities for which they have marked preferences.

Accordingly, if \\na particular candidate has not given a preference to a course of study of a university (Uni-Code) for \\nwhich he/she could have been selected according to the Z score, he/she would not be allocated to \\nthat course of study and the university for which he/she has not in dicated a preference.

Instead, his/her applicatio n will be considered for the next \\ncourse of study preferred. \\n \\n Students are advised to read the example named “Important” given in page no 113-115 of \\nthe University Admissions Handbook valid for the academic year 2023/2024 for further \\nclarifications in this regard. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNote 11: Candidates are permitted to change their  order of “Uni-Codes” online within two (02) \\nweeks from the closing date for university admission applications  as mentioned in \\nSection 3.3 of the University Admissions Handbook valid for the academic year 202 3/ \\n2024,  \\n \\n The duly signed and dated printed copy of the candidate’s new order of “Uni -Codes” \\nshould be sent by the registered post to reach the Deputy Secretary/ University \\nAdmissions, University Grants Commission, No. 20, Ward Place, Colombo 07 within two \\n(02) weeks from the closing date for university admission applications. \\n \\n Candidates are advised to read the Section 3.3 of the University Admissions Handbook \\nvalid for the academic year 2023/2024 for other required details in this regard.'),\n",
